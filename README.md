# PuzzleSolver
python program for solving a (already) digitalized puzzle with computer vision and classical algorithms

working on:
- detection of edges and corners of each piece
- categorizing the sides of each piece (male/female/edge/corner)
- combining pieces due to its geometry and colors
- comparing position of pieces with given picture

in the end, the program should be capable of solving a 1000-pieces jigsaw puzzle in moderate time by using home-level computer performance
